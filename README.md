# <b>AASD 4011 - Mathematical Concepts for Deep Learning Group Project</b>

The goal of this project is to explore the potential of deep learning in predicting the direction of Bitcoin's price. Our aim is to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to analyze historical price data of Bitcoin in USD. The objective is to provide a more stable and robust model compared to directly predicting the price itself. To increase the accuracy of our model, we will incorporate the Rolling Mean of Momentum as a feature and optimize the model through hyper-parameter tuning. This feature provides information about the trend of the price and helps our model capture underlying patterns in the data, and it incorporates the concept of AR (Autoregressive) by using different lags. Our ultimate goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the direction of Bitcoin's price, providing insights and opportunities for traders and investors. We will also compare our results with a stock prediction model built in a previous Deep Learning course to see if this data preprocessing enhances the performance of the model.
